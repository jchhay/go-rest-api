The main components of a Golang project structure include directories for source code, tests, documentation, scripts, and configuration files. A common layout is: [2]

cmd/ - Contains main package/executable. This is where the main.go file lives which kicks off the app.
pkg/ - Contains reusable code packages. These packages can be imported and used by multiple applications.
internal/ - For private packages and code that is only used internally by the project. This helps enforce encapsulation.
api/ - Contains code related to building a REST/GraphQL API. This includes request/response models, router, controllers etc.
models/ - Contains data models and structs used by your application.
repositories/ - Contains data layer logic for database related job such as querying, inserting/storing or deleting
services/ - Contains business logic code for services, independent of transport/protocol.
config/ - Contains app configuration files.
scripts/ - Contains scripts for building, testing, deploying etc.
docs/ - Contains documentation for your project.
tests/ - Contains test files, organized the same way as code packages.
This structure clearly separates different concerns like API, business logic, models etc. It keeps things organized and test/code packages modular and reusable. I'd recommend starting with this standard layout to keep your Golang project tidy and scalable. Let me know if any part needs more explanation!
